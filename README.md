These files used to exist but have since been deleted. In some world where you need them, here's their final commit:
- [`ActPackMan.py`](https://github.com/UM-LoCoLab/NeuroLocoMiddleware/blob/a6b5e73d415da1fc3d97945d636fbe1589187140/ActPackMan.py#L1) This wrapper class was written for the Dephy actpacks. It has been superseded by the implementation in the [OpenSourceLeg library](https://github.com/neurobionics/opensourceleg). 
- [`EB51Man.py`](https://github.com/UM-LoCoLab/NeuroLocoMiddleware/blob/a6b5e73d415da1fc3d97945d636fbe1589187140/EB51Man.py#L1) A wrapper class for the Dephy ExoBoots, last used by Katharine Walters. Included belt tightening, nonlinear gear ratio, and other booty features.
- [`FileGlobal.py`](https://github.com/UM-LoCoLab/NeuroLocoMiddleware/blob/a6b5e73d415da1fc3d97945d636fbe1589187140/FileGlobal.py#L1) Last used by Prof. Gray Thomas. Not sure what this does. 
- [`MBLUEmod.py`](https://github.com/UM-LoCoLab/NeuroLocoMiddleware/blob/a6b5e73d415da1fc3d97945d636fbe1589187140/MBLUEmod.py#L1) This looks like an initial software library for the MBLUE exos but it isn't used anymore. Latest commit was from Prof. Gray Thomas. There are likely other places to start if you're controlling MBLUE. It also seems like it has some test bench functionality, if you're curious. 
- [`SysID.py`](https://github.com/UM-LoCoLab/NeuroLocoMiddleware/blob/a6b5e73d415da1fc3d97945d636fbe1589187140/SysID.py#L1) Yet again from the illustrious Prof. Gray Thomas, this script generates a chirp signal to be used in a frequency-based sys id. 
- [`frequency_analysis.py`](https://github.com/UM-LoCoLab/NeuroLocoMiddleware/blob/a6b5e73d415da1fc3d97945d636fbe1589187140/frequency_analysis.py#L1) This script makes a bode plot based on measured data. Talk to Prof. Gray Thomas.
