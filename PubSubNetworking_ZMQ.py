"""
This module implements a publisher/subscriber networking protocol using ZMQ. Its development was motivated by the need to share timestamps between two python programs on different PCs. My current usage is to have the OSL as a publisher of its current log timestamp. A script on a Vicon PC will subscribe to that timestamp to embed sync behavior in a vicon log. 

See the test_sub() and test_pub() methods for example usages. 

Requires pyzmq
